            <strong class="title">Saturday Hangout</strong>
                    <p class="tab">Most every Saturday during the school semester, on the fourth floor of the Kent State Library 
                        (or virtually if the weather isn't nice), KSU CS students host a hangout! From about 10am - 2pm, 
                        students can get together and work on homework and ask for help, play games, or just chat!</p>

            <strong class="title">Kent Hack Enough</strong>
                    <p class="tab">Hosted by the fine folk at HacKSU, typically in the fall semester, 
                        Kent Hack Enough is our very own hackathon! A hackathon is a weekend-long coding event where people get together 
                        and have 24 hours to code a tech-related project. There are also talks, recruiters, and free goodies!</p>

            <strong class="title">Tutoring</strong>
                    <p class="tab">Tutoring <em>by</em> the students, <em>for</em> the students! Both virtually via Blackboard 
                        (though this may be subject to change if KSU is completely switching to Canvas) and in-person in MSB 
                        (the Math and Sciences Building) 243. Tutoring is typically offered for most core classes but 
                        tutors will help with all they can!</p>
