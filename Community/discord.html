            <p class="tab">The KSU CS Discord was created back in 2018. Anyone is free to join, whether you're not quite 
                into your first year of college, about to graduate or any point in-between! There are chats for (hopefully) all 
                Computer Science core classes and electives, but you can always ask the moderation team to add one if it's missing. 
                There are also general chats, for topics like video games, movies and TV shows, some amazing food you had the other 
                day; it's not just for Computer Science, its a place for students to fit in and find friends! Students are updated 
                regularly about events that concern the CS department whether that be get-togethers, changes on campus or changes 
                in class offerings! All of the information listed in the previous two pages is also available in the KSU CS Discord 
                in one form or another.
